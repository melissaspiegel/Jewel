# ⚠️ Live Trading Implementation ⚠️

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**THIS SOFTWARE CAN TRADE WITH REAL CRYPTOCURRENCY AND REAL MONEY.**

Trading cryptocurrency involves significant risk of financial loss. Use this software at your own risk. The authors and contributors are not responsible for any financial losses incurred by using this software.

## Safety First

1. **START WITH PAPER TRADING MODE** - Paper trading is enabled by default in the configuration file.
2. **USE SMALL AMOUNTS** - When you eventually use real funds, start with very small amounts.
3. **UNDERSTAND THE RISKS** - Algorithmic trading can lead to rapid losses if not properly monitored.
4. **MONITOR CLOSELY** - Never leave the bot running unattended for long periods.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install ccxt pandas numpy matplotlib
   ```

2. **Set up your API keys**
   - Get API keys from your chosen exchange (Binance, Coinbase, etc.)
   - Edit `config/config.json` and add your API keys
   - Never share your API keys or commit them to version control

3. **Configure your trading parameters**
   - Edit trading pair, take profit levels, stop loss, etc. in `config/config.json`
   - Keep `paper_trading_mode` set to `true` until you're confident in the strategy

4. **Run in paper trading mode first**
   ```bash
   python live_trader.py
   ```

5. **Monitor results and adjust strategy parameters as needed**

## Going Live (Use Extreme Caution)

If you decide to use real funds:

1. Edit `config/config.json`:
   ```json
   "risk_management": {
     "trading_enabled": true,
     "max_daily_trades": 5,
     "max_daily_drawdown_percent": 5
   },
   "advanced": {
     "paper_trading_mode": false,
     ...
   }
   ```

2. Start with a very small amount of funds
3. Closely monitor all trades
4. Be prepared to manually intervene if needed

## Differences from Game Version

The live trading implementation differs from the game version in several important ways:

1. **Real Financial Risk** - Trading with actual cryptocurrency instead of simulated funds
2. **Exchange Integration** - Connects to real exchanges through their APIs 
3. **Additional Safety Features** - Risk limits, daily trade caps, and drawdown protection
4. **Failure Handling** - More robust error handling for API issues, network problems, etc.
5. **Paper Trading Mode** - Simulates trades without using real funds for testing

## Emergency Stop

If you need to stop trading immediately:
1. Press CTRL+C in the terminal running the trader
2. If needed, manually close positions on the exchange website/app
